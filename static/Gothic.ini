zFogRadial=1
; ... enables radial fog. this could be somehow slower on some grafic cards, but looks smoother. set to "0" if you have any problems with it
; some cards without T&L don't support radial fog. On these cards, (although they are unsupported) it may be wise to deactivate radial fog.

zVidRefreshRate=0
; ... overrides the windows default refresh rate. enter a value above 75 to make your eyes happier (default: 0)

geforce3HackWBufferBug=1
; ... some geforce 3 or geforce 4 cards have problems with gothics way to access the w buffer, resulting in flickering polys
; in the distant. with this setting set to "1" these cards automatically use a z buffer, loosing some precision near the camera but without the flickering polys.
; the driver version 12.41 does not have this problem. if you you have this version installed you may set this to 0 in order to activate the better looking
; w buffer. Driver versions later than 30.82 may not have this problem either.


zSyncAmbientCol=0
; ... some grafic drivers have problems with gothics way to access the ambient lightning on a per object base but want the ambient
; light on a per scene base. this is a driver bug! if there occurs heavily lightning flickering with objects, you might set this setting
; to "1" to synchronize the ambient color after each object. this forces the driver to flush the scene after each objects which can
; seriously degrade performance (especially if you activate antialiasing!)

radeonHackAmbientColBug=0
; ... the radeon 9700 has known problems with accessing the ambient lightning on a per object base, thus using the above "zSyncAmbientCol"
; Feature automatically. By activating the workaround for this card, performance may drop about 10%. Fullscene antialiasing does not work
; fast enough on this card until ATI fixes the ambient col driver bug.
; if you set this setting to "0" and no object lightning flickering occurs, ATI has probably managed to fix the problem and you may enable antialiasing

; in order to improve speed

zVobPointLight=0
; ... enables (1) or disables (0) additional dynamic lights for indoor objects, greatly improving details. you should left this as it is, although in can improve indoor performance.

ZNEARVALUE=-1
; ... with this setting you may fine-tune the distant-value of the near clipping plane. some cards may accept more aggresive near z values then the default calculated
; by gothic. (w buffering uses alway a value of 1, so you don't need to fine-tune this setting) (default: -1, let the value determin by renderer)

zSkyRenderFirst=1
; ... enables (0) or disables (1) an additional way to workaround the flickering poly in the distant on geforce 3 or geforce 4 cards.
; if you set this to "0" the sky will be renderer after the normal game world thus overlaying the flickering polys. this does only work with 32 bit
; color enabled and if you set the value "geforce3HackWBufferBug" to "0". the drawback is that the sky is slightly distorted, but this should be the best
; workaround for most geforce 3/4 users as the flicker polys are more annoying. moreover you can't see through walls with this workaround any more
; (default: 1)

zMaxFPS=0
; ... some rare gfx hardware may have problems with gothics way to access the timer, resulting in jerky animations.
; with this setting set to a fixed value (e.g. 20) you can avoid choppy animations on those systems
; the spacer needs a fixed value here in order to work properly during editing small ZEN Files

zAmbientPFXEnabled=0
; ... enables (1) or disables (0) rendering of ambient particles. rendering ambient particles greatly limits your fillrate, so if you have a card with less
; fill-rate capabilities (e.g. geforce 2 MX versions) you may set this to "0" to improve performance. (default: 1)

zAmbientVobsEnabled=1
; ... enables (1) or disables (0) rendering of ambient objects. not used in gothic 2

zEnvMappingEnabled=0

zKillSysKeys=0
; ... enables (1) or disables (0) the window keys as ALT-TAB, ALT-ESC, etc... GOTHIC handles focus-loss by going to windowed-pause mode, so
; there is no real need to deactivate the keys (moreover, disallowing those keys is more of a hack than a feature).
; this feature is untested and unsupported.

zSmoothMouse=3
zTexCacheSizeMaxBytes=2146435072
; ... with this setting you can smooth your mouse movements by averaging the last [n] frame moves. higher values result in laggier but smoother mouse response.
; (default: 3) ATTENTION: modifying this value may result in different gameplay.

zMusic16ChannelsOnly=0
; ... if you have 256 MB or less memory, you can force the music system to use only 16 channels, thus killing several instruments and performances.
; ATTENTION: setting this to "1" reduces music quality but can improve performance. If music is not important for you, you have the choice to only
; use 16 channels.

zInventoryItemsDistanceScale=1.3
; ... some rare grafic cards have a high near clipping value resulting in inventory items not being visible (esp. if you have the cursor focus on it)
; with entering a value above "0" you can scale the item distances from the camera in order to make the items smaller, but visible
; (e.g. with a value of 2.0 the items will be twice as far away from the camera)
; range: 0..1000. (default: 1.3)

zWindEnabled=1
